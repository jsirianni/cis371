  <div id="ABOUT">
    <p> My name is Joe Sirianni and I am a Senior at Grand Valley.
      I am a DevOps Intern at Blue Medora, a software company in Grand Rapids.</p>

    <p>I play on a semi-profesional Xball team (a style of Tournement Paintball).
      We travel around the country, and sometimes outside of the country, to compete
      against other teams in several regional and international leagues</p>

    <p>Outside of school, work, and paintball I enjoy working on my homelab,
      working out, riding my bike, camping, kyaking, and playing Arma 3</p>
